# 🗑️ Waste Classification using Transfer Learning (TensorFlow)

This project uses transfer learning (VGG16) to classify images of waste into categories such as recyclable and organic, helping automate the waste sorting process for sustainability-focused companies like EcoClean.

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Apply transfer learning using VGG16
- Fine-tune the model for specific waste classification
- Evaluate model performance using visualizations
- Support real-world automation in waste sorting

## 🧠 Model Summary
